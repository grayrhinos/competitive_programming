Tricks, hacks, optimizations, and ideas for competitive programming platforms.

If you are Windows user and haven't set up Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) on your machine I strongly recommend you do so. 
By enabling Remote - WSL extension on you Visual Studio Code you can directly use WSL as your coding environment directly from VS Code.
It is super convenient and efficient for testing during competitive programing.
Here are some links from Windows docs that might help:
1. [Windows Subsystem for Linux Installation Guide for Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
2. [Get started using Visual Studio Code with Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode)
